# Goal
The program is to analyze text with hashtable as data structure.

# Implementation
Compile the program using: gcc -Wall -g -std=c99 list.c hash.c mainFunction.c main.c

The program should be executed as: ./a.out -f First_File_Name -s Second_File_name

Note that, the first file is the file to be analyzed, and the second file should be an empty file that is used to store the results (results will also be printed on terminal)
